# Simplified SEP Approximations of Coherent Digital Modulation Schemes over α − κ − μ Fading

In this paper, we propose novel, simplified yet tight approximations of the error probability expressions of numerous digital modulation schemes over a popular α − κ − μ fading channel. With the help of a suitable approximation of the Gaussian $Q$ function and utilization of Taylor's series expansion, we facilitate the cumbersome integrals which play a key role in simplification of the performance evaluation metrics like symbol error probability (SEP) of various digital modulation schemes. This facilitates cost effective receiver's design making the overall system economically viable. We further illustrate the accuracy of the proposed SEP expressions with the help of the relative error. An insight on the truncation error (and its upper bound) is also highlighted in this paper. We also compute the relative error in the upper bound of the truncation error to further justify the accuracy of the proposed integrals. Moreover, the asymptotic expressions for the integrals are also provided which gives an idea regarding diversity order of the wireless communication systems for large signal to noise ratios.
